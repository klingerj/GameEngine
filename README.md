# GameEngine

# Weekly Update
10/5/18   
In its current state, the project is nothing more than code from vulkan-tutorial.com.  
* The master branch is currently a "Hello Triangle" application.
* This branch is capable of loading and rendering OBJ files. Texture loading and sampling is also in progress on this branch.
* The multithreading branch has some sample code regarding multithreading and will serve as a playground for multithreading-related features, such as resource loading. It will ultimately be used for things like command buffer creation, UI, and potentially things like terrain generation.  
(Quick update 10/7/18):  
* Texture loading is now complete.
* Camera class has been added with view/projection matrices
