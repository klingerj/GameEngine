# The Joe Engine

[![](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/kml8nhwm1lu4tr1c?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/klingerj/joe-engine)

The goal of the Joe Engine is to be my C++ playground. The engine will contain various engine programming experiments and features related to rendering, systems, and performance.  

### Demo
Brief [demo video](https://vimeo.com/326088400) here.

### Current features
* Deferred Renderer
* Post Processing
* Shadow Mapping
* (Buggy) Rigidbody Simulation
* Threadpool
