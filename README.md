# GameEngine

#### Weekly Update
10/16/18
Couple of things added so far:
- some general code cleanup  
- depth buffer  
- Dynamic UBOs for model matrices  

10/13/18  
The project has been updated to include a thread pool that allows for the queueing up of workloads and efficient dispatching of them. Currently, it outperforms std::async. It still needs to be cleanly refactored into a file and then properly merged in a pull request. No other modifications were made to the Vulkan renderer.  

(Quick update 10/7/18):  
* Texture loading is now complete.
* Camera class has been added with view/projection matrices  

10/5/18  
In its current state, the project is nothing more than code from vulkan-tutorial.com.  
* The master branch is currently a "Hello Triangle" application.
* This branch is capable of loading and rendering OBJ files. Texture loading and sampling is also in progress on this branch.
* The multithreading branch has some sample code regarding multithreading and will serve as a playground for multithreading-related features, such as resource loading. It will ultimately be used for things like command buffer creation, UI, and potentially things like terrain generation.
