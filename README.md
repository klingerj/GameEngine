The goal of the Joe Engine is to be my C++ playground. The engine will contain various engine programming experiments and features related to rendering, systems, and performance.  

### Documentation
View the docs [here](https://klingerj.github.io/html/) (in-progress).

### Demo
Brief [demo video](https://vimeo.com/326088400) here.

### Current features
* Data-oriented Entity-Component System
* Material System
* Deferred Renderer
* Instanced rendering
* Post Processing (Now broken after addition of material system :) )
* Shadow Mapping
* Frustum Culling
* (Buggy) Rigidbody Simulation
* Threadpool
